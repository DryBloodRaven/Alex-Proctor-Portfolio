            <p>After graduating Cum Laude from Arizona State University, I began working for Chubb as an Endorsement Underwriter 
            for commercial lines. After six months, I was moved into a specialized role that worked on Large Real Estate and 
            Entertainment accounts. I was then promoted to an Underwriting Associate. During my tenure at Chubb, I continued my 
            education by completing AINS 21 and 23 courses. </p>
            <p>After 4 years of working in insurance, I decided I wanted to reboot my career and pursued a career with Microsoft. I 
            started working for the Microsoft Store as a Services Advisor in 2018. Over the course of the next 6 months, I provided a 
            variety of technical resources for multiple Microsoft products to drive the sale, deployment, and adoption of Microsoft 
            solutions. In June of 2019, I was promoted to Cloud Technical Expert. In this new role I am tasked with engaging 
            customers to determine both potential business and personal needs to further identify opportunities for Microsoft cloud 
            solutions.</p>
            <p>My career within Microsoft has fostered my ability to learn, grow, and keep an open mind in order to provide the best 
            possible customer experience.</p>
